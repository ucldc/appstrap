Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances
==================================================

In many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a Tomcat
binary distribution shared among multiple users on the same server.  To make
this possible, you can set the $CATALINA_BASE environment variable to the
directory that contains the files for your 'personal' Tomcat instance.

When you use $CATALINA_BASE, Tomcat will calculate all relative references for
files in the following directories based on the value of $CATALINA_BASE instead
of $CATALINA_HOME:

* bin  - Only setenv.sh (*nix), setenv.bat (windows) and tomcat-juli.jar

* conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)

* logs - Log and output files

* webapps - Automatically loaded web applications

* work - Temporary working directories for web applications

* temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files (java.io.tmpdir)

Note that by default Tomcat will first try to load classes and JARs from
$CATALINA_BASE/lib and then $CATALINA_HOME/lib. You can place instance specific
JARs and classes (e.g. JDBC drivers) in $CATALINA_BASE/lib whilst keeping the
standard Tomcat JARs in $CATALINA_HOME/lib.  

If you do not set $CATALINA_BASE, $CATALINA_BASE will default to the same value
as $CATALINA_HOME, which means that the same directory is used for all relative
path resolutions.
